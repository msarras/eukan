"""Cross-pipeline artifact registry.

A single source of truth for files that cross pipeline boundaries —
written by one pipeline, read by another. Centralizing the filenames
means renaming an artifact is one edit instead of grepping the codebase.

Two flavours of artifact:

* **Static** — fixed filename, lives in its producer step's work_dir.
  Use the :class:`Artifact` enum and :func:`find`.
* **Dynamic** — filename derived from the genome stem (e.g.
  ``<stem>.masked.fasta``). Helper functions live next to the enum.

Each artifact knows which step produces it (:data:`_PRODUCER`). Lookups
first check the caller's ``work_dir`` (for flat layouts and direct
in-step references) and then fall back to the producer's sibling step
directory under the run-dir layout — see :mod:`eukan.infra.layout`.
