"""Conda environment configuration for external tools.

Reads per-tool env-var and PATH fields from :mod:`tools_registry` and
separates *safe* global env-var setup from *subprocess-only* settings
(like ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``) that would break system tools if leaked into
the parent process.

Usage::

    # Once at CLI startup (cli.py):
    from eukan.infra.environ import configure_process_env
    configure_process_env()

    # Per-subprocess (runner.py):
    from eukan.infra.environ import subprocess_env
    subprocess.run(cmd, env=subprocess_env())
